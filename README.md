# 2D Space Navigation ME 369 Final Project

## Collaborators
Nathan Lee, Isaac Sorensen, Philip Bortolotti


## Phases
0. Initialize Universe with Spaceship w/ Initial Conditions -- By 11/8 (Sat)
1. Rocket through stationary universe with stationary target -- By 11/8 (Sat)
2. Rocket through moving universe with stationary target -- By 11/10 (Mon)
3. Rocket through moving universe with moving target -- By 11/12 (Wed)
4. Pursuit (Real-Time Prediction) -- After Thurs 11/13

## Task List

1. Create a version control procedure (Isaac)
2. Expand/Create Plotting Function (Nate)
3. Update Vector Class
4. Update Body Class
5. Add a net-force vector to the spaceship
6. Body.Update()
7. 

simulator:

t = 1.56
spaceship.update()
bodies.update()


1. How is our animation process going to work? How will we step through time?
2. How will we plot vector fields?
3. How will we numerically solve the spaceship path?
4. How will we implement thrust? (Angle and magnitude)
5. Optimization
    i. Make cost function
    ii. Parameterize path
    iii. Update cost function stuff


Vector field
1. Initialize objects
2. 

## Isaac's Most Recent Notes
We're moving onto the path planning portion of the project, here's where it get's interesting...

Essentially, we'll need to do some interesting GNC stuff

I think these are the things we'll need to start digging into!
