## Simplifying Assumptions
** The universe is empty except for our objects
** All objects are treated as point masses
** Newtonian orbital mechanics
** Collision mechanics are ignored
** For navigation all orbits will be stable
** Spaceship’s gravity does not affect other bodies
** Spaceship can apply thrust in any direction at any time
** Spaceship’s mass does not change based on thrust usage
